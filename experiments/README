The following steps apply to both examples. The only difference is that E3L_6DO3 is using Enamine REAL library and Nav_5EK0 is using ZINC22 libaray. In E3L_6DO3, there are steps to generate mol2 files with mmff94 partial charges from SMILES while in Nav_5EK0, the steps are extracting mol2 files from ZINC22 provided tgz files. The different steps can be found in the 'scripts/run_all.sh'

1. Generate the initial configure files for the project
cd scripts
python init_config.py

2. Randomly choose params files from the drug-like centroids database for the first iteration:
cd scripts
python extract_starting_params.py

3. Tar the folders containing the params files and move the Tar files to screeing/params, e.g. tar -cf validation_params_0.tar validation_params

4. Generate the inputs file for virtual screening by running:
cd screening
python gen_screening_inputs.py, change the prefix to the name that matches the Tar params file, e.g. "train1"

5. cd to the working directory, e.g. "train1" folder, and generate the slurm task array jobs and submission scripts:
cd train1
python gen_joblist_production.py
sh submit_arrayjobs.sh

6. Tar the folders in the outputs folder

7. Go to scripts folder, change the 'curr_iter' to the current iteration number in 'run_all.sh' and run through the commands in this file. This will generate a folder containing new params files for the next iteration virtual screening. To be more specific, if curr_iter=1, the new params folder will be 'scratch/params/train2_params'

8. Repeat 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 until a stop criterion has been met. 

After the virtual screening runs, follow "scripts/post_analysis.sh" for post virtual screening analysis.


A working example of running RosettaVS VSX mode is provided in E3L_6DO3. Following the above steps, the example will dock randomly select 10 or 20 molecules for E3L_6DO3 or Nav_5EK0 from databases/centroids. The params file can be found in the scratch/{project_folder}/params. Following step 3 and 4, it will dock the selected molecules. The expected output files, {project_name}_0_*.out and {project_name}_0_*.score.sc can be found in {project_folder}/screening/outputs. The running time is around 90-200 seconds per ligand.
